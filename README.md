# Shoebill Wrapper Generator
This project converts .inc files from pawn to .java files for Shoebill. Please keep in mind that this project is not finished yet. Itâ€™s in an early stage and the code looks really messy right now and probably does not always work like it should. If you find any errors or bugs, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/Shoebill/wrapper-generator/issues/new) with an detailed description of your problem.

# What you will need
* Python ([Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/), [OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/))
* [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) and [cidl](https://github.com/Zeex/cidl) (can be installed via pip)
* An .idl you want to convert (use FCNPC.idl as an example)

# How to use

Open an command prompt an type in:
```
python main.py idls/FCNPC.idl
```
After the process has been finished, you will get 3 files which contain native functions, callbacks and definitions.
